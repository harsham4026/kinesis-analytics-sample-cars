### Flink sample using Cars

This maven project implements a simple Flink app processing Cars input dataset.
You will need to use an IAM role that allows publishing cloudwatch metric, as this
sample app uses a cloudwatch metric sink to write avg speed of car seen within last 30 seconds. (Metric is written within namespace KDA/MyFlink/Events)

### Build (Locally)

The package depends on flink kinesis connector that is not available in Maven repository, you can build it
locally by downloading flink 1.6.2 source.
Once you have compliled and added flink kinesis connector add it to local maven repository by using following command-line:

````
 mvn install:install-file    -Dfile=/Users/ahmedmsy/Downloads/flink-connector-kinesis_2.11-1.6.2.jar -DgroupId=org.apache.flink -DartifactId=flink-connector-kinesis_2.11 -Dversion=1.6.2 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true

````

After that cd to this repository and issue following
````
mvn package


````
./target folder will contain the shaded kinesis-analytics-sample-cars-1.0.jar ready for deployment to AWS Kinesis Analytics as a Java App.

### Build (Using AWS Code Pipeline)

As an alternate to building locally, you can use provided Cloud Formation template to build sample project jar files in the cloud (this will also generate  flink kinesis connector jar for any future projects use).

Once Code Build is completed, simply check the output artifacts of the cloud formation stack and copy the built jar files from the S3 bucket to locally or to another S3 folder for deployment as kinesis analytics service.

You can also skip copyin the jar file and use the generated jar file (uploaded to the S3 bucket by Code pipeline) to be executed as Kinesis Analytics Java (Flink) app.


### Deployment
This sample uses parallelism of 4, either reduce that in code or
use following configuration when creating Kinesis Analytics app
"ParallelismConfiguration": 
        {"AutoScalingEnabled": true, 
         "ConfigurationType": "CUSTOM", 
         "CurrentParallelism": 4, 
         "Parallelism": 4, 
         "ParallelismPerKPU": 2
         }

### Simulating source stream

To simulate input stream, create a stream named "input-stream" in your account.
Each message sent to stream should use following JSON format:


````
{"dataTimestamp":"2018-12-07 22:56:36.589","vehicleId": "69b6d839-2273-407f-bdae-03f535596223","latitude":47.67,"longitude":-122.24,"speed":172.69,"fuelEfficiency":67.21,"destinationLatitude":47.62,"destinationLongitude":-122.11,"hasMoonRoof":true,"engineTemperature":415}
````

You can use following python script to generate sample event:


````

import boto
import json
import decimal
from datetime import datetime
import time
import uuid
import boto3

client = boto3.client('kinesis')

streamName = 'input-stream'


time = datetime.utcnow()
timeString = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")[:-3]
vId = "\"" + str(uuid.uuid4()) + "\""
message ="{\"dataTimestamp\":\"" + timeString + "\",\"vehicleId\": " + vId + ""","latitude":47.67,"longitude":-122.24,"speed":172.69,"fuelEfficiency":67.21,"destinationLatitude":47.62,"destinationLongitude":-122.11,"hasMoonRoof":true,"engineTemperature":415}"""
 

print("sending message: " + message)
response = client.put_record(
    StreamName=streamName,
    Data=message,
    PartitionKey='nokey'
)
print("sent to " + str( response ) )
print('DONE')


````



### AWS Create App cli JSON skeleton

You can use following as an example json passed to create-application CLI call to AWS
